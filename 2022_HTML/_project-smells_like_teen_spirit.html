        Load up on guns, bring your friends
        It's fun to lose and to pretend
        She's over bored and self assured
        Oh no, I know a dirty word
        Hello, hello, hello, how low
        Hello, hello, hello, how low
        Hello, hello, hello, how low
        Hello, hello, hello
        With the lights out, it's less dangerous
        Here we are now, entertain us
        I feel stupid and contagious
        Here we are now, entertain us
        A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
        Yeah, hey
        Yay
        I'm worse at what I do best
        And for this gift I feel blessed
        Our little group has always been
        And always will until the end
        Hello, hello, hello, how low
        Hello, hello, hello, how low
        Hello, hello, hello, how low
        Hello, hello, hello
        With the lights out, it's less dangerous
        Here we are now, entertain us
        I feel stupid and contagious
        Here we are now, entertain us
        A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
        Yeah, hey
        Yay
        And I forget just why I taste
        Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
        I found it hard, was hard to find
        Oh well, whatever, never mind
        Hello, hello, hello, how low
        Hello, hello, hello, how low
        Hello, hello, hello, how low
        Hello, hello, hello
        With the lights out, it's less dangerous
        Here we are now, entertain us
        I feel stupid and contagious
        Here we are now, entertain us
        A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
        A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
        A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
